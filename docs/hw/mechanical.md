## Attachment Tips and Tricks
### Self-tapping screws with bosses
The Create® 3 robot's holes are sized for M3 or #4 screws.
It is possible to use special self-tapping plastic screws (or in a pinch, sheet metal or wood screws) to screw through the cover into a 3D-printed boss.
Many of our example STLs use this technique.
### Machine screws with nuts
The Create® 3 robot's holes are sized for M3 or #4 screws.
### Cable ties
Cable ties (also known as zip ties) can be threaded through the 3 mm holes.
2.5 mm widths are common and fit nicely.
### Twist ties
Twist ties are a quick, cheap, and reusable way for holding wires or other non-structural pieces. 
### Plastic Rivets
Push-in, split-shank plastic rivets (either for M3 or 0.115" holes) are fast and inexpensive ways to mount thin stock to the Create® 3 robot's faceplate.
### Highly sophisticated interlocking brick system
The typical toy brick has its studs spaced at 8 mm, while Create® 3's holes are spaced at 12 mm.
It is possible to place an [adapter (576 kB)](data/C3-Stud-Mount.stl) into every other hole in order to connect toy bricks to the Create® 3.
We recommend printing at 100% infill.
