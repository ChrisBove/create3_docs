# iRobot® Create® 3 Buttons and Light Ring

## Buttons
The iRobot® Create® 3 has three buttons on its top face.
These buttons expose core functionality of the robot, but can also be overridden by the user.

### Left Button
The left button is marked with a single dot (•).
If held for ten seconds, the robot will go into "standby" mode, keeping its charging circuitry active, and continuing to power the payload.
The robot can be placed on the dock to charge or to keep the payload alive in this mode.
To wake the robot from standby, hold the center button for one second.
Button presses can be accessed by the user in both ROS 2 and iRobot Coding / Bluetooth[^1] modes.

### Right Button
The right button is marked with two dots (••).
This button is a user button only.
Button presses can be accessed by the user in both ROS 2 and iRobot Coding / Bluetooth[^1] modes.

### Center Button
The center button is marked with a power (⏻) icon.
If held for seven seconds, the robot will go into "storage mode," disconnecting its internal battery from the robot and its payload.
When the robot is in storage mode, the only way to power it on is to place it on the dock.
The button also contains a light ring on its circumference.

## Light Ring
The center button contains a ring of six RGB LEDs which communicate state about the robot.
The LEDs expose internal state information about the robot, but can also be overridden by the user.
