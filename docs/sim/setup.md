# Using the iRobot® Create® 3 Simulator

We provide a ROS 2 Gazebo simulation stack for the iRobot® Create® 3 Educational Robot.
Have a look at its [Github repository](https://github.com/iRobotEducation/create3_sim).
The Github repository contains instructions for how to building and running the simulator on your laptop.

This application completely simulates a Create® 3 robot, thus exposing to the user all the same [ROS 2 APIs](../api/ros2.md) as the real robot.

You will be able to use the iRobot® Create® 3 Simulator to quickly develop your new applications and eventually run them on the real robot without having to change anything.
